## Note

This was a project made for fun, if you think I'm weird for making this, **DM me on Discord so I can ignore you**.

Also, this bot will **_(probably)_ be maintained for a while**, might even get some other devs to help me out with developing this bot, but no promises, if you do want to help out, please view [Contributing]()

## Contributing

This project is _(so far)_ developed by just me, but you can help out too! Here are all the ways you can help out with developing this bot!

### Creating an issue/pull request

This project is open source, which means any issues or pull requests are highly valued and welcome!

### Giving Me Ideas

Now, I'm going to be honest, I'm omega stupid and can't come up with many good ideas, but of course, you guys can help kickstart new ideas! Here's how you can push some ideas to me!

#### From Discord (preferred)

You can drop me a DM on Discord with your idea(s), maybe even explain how you would implement it _(which is completely optional, I don't expect everyone to be a developer)_. Just drop me a friend request _(or just be in a mutual server with me, whichever you prefer)_, here's my Discord tag for clarity: `Yoshiboi18303#6732`

#### From Twitch

Twitch is where I'm streaming a lot of my gameplay, if you want to submit your ideas about the bot there, that's completely acceptable, just note that I'm a no mic streamer _(and I don't have a second monitor)_, so don't expect a response immediately.

Just head **[here](https://twitch.tv/yoshiboi18303)**, make an account _(if you haven't already)_, wait until I go live, then send your suggestion there!

I hope you guys enjoy this bot, it took me a **LOT** of time, and I almost went mentally insane, so...
